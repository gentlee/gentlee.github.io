This is a statically generated (SSG) [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

2. Copy images from articles to public with:

```bash
npm run clean-and-copy-images
```

3. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy

Push to the `main` branch. Github action will do the rest (e.g. running `npm run build`).
